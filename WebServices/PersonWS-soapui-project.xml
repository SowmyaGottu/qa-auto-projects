  <wsdl:documentation>The Chrome River Person Web Service fulfills requests from our customers to create/update/delete person records, as well as add/remove person-entity relationships in the Chrome River system.

To get started with Person Web Service, please submit a Chrome River Help Desk ticket. Our Implementation team will work with you to get everything set up and running.

To access this service, use this Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file to generate the required client proxy classes: https://api.chromeriver.com/ws_PersonV1?wsdl

Please also read this documentation to understand what it does and how to properly prepare requests.

Logging In

Each request to access this service must be authenticated via either login credentials or a session token. The Login Web Service may be used to submit the user's login information in a request consisting of companyID, userID, and password. The user will receive a token to submit with subsequent requests to other Chrome River Web Services, eliminating the need to provide the login information again.

While it is also possible to submit login information directly via the header of the Person Web Service, it is recommended that customers use the Login Web Service first to obtain a session token, and then submit this token in each subsequent request to the Person Service.

Chrome River Person Web Service Overview

Please use the following description as a reference, but do not hesitate to contact us at support@chromeriver.com should you run into problems or have questions.

There are eight operations exposed via the Person Web Service: createPerson, updatePerson, deletePerson, addEntity, removeEntity, addPersonDelegate, deletePersonDelegate and getPersonDetails. Each call to createPerson or udpatePerson or deletePerson either creates or updates or deletes a single person record in the Chrome River system for the requesting customer. Each call to addEntity or removeEntity either adds or removes a single person-entity association in the Chrome River system for the requesting customer. Each call to addPersonDelegate adds a new delegate for the person or updates it, if it exists, deletePersonDelegate removes a person-delegate relationship. Calling getPersonDetails with a customerUniqueId as input will return information about the corresponding person or a validation error (code 501) to indicate no such person exists. More specifically, if the person exists in our system, a Person object is returned (as the webServicePayload value of the envelope; see below), the same type (with the same fields) as the Person input to the create/update operations that are documented below.

Each call to one of the first seven operations (createPerson, updatePerson, deletePerson, addEntity, removeEntity, addPersonDelegate and deletePersonDelegate) requires two input objects: the LoginCredentials object and the Person, PersonDelegate or Entity object or Customer Unique ID, depending on the operation. The former contains either the full login information or a session token, while the latter contains input parameter values (those that are optional may be omitted) required to complete the request. The eighth operation (getPersonDetails) expects the same LoginCredentials object and a string representing the customer unique ID to be queried against.

The service responds to a request with the MessageEnvelope object. In the event of a successful outcome, the envelope will contain the statusCode "ReturnStatusCode.SUCCESS." In the event of a failed outcome, the envelope will contain the statusCode "ReturnStatusCode.FAIL," along with a list of ValidationError objects detailing why the request was not completed successfully.

Each ValidationError contains three pieces of information: the error code, the name of the error code, and a brief message explaining the error. For example, in a createPerson request, if the incoming customerUniqueID already points to an existing person in our system, the response envelope will contain the ValidationError with error code "500," the name "ObjectExists," and the message "Person with customerUniqueID jdoe already exists." (In this case, "jdoe" is the customerUniqueID submitted in the request.)

It is recommended that each error message be processed, the input be corrected, and the request be retried at a later time. Also note that each request is first authenticated before further processing, so that if the token or the login credentials are not valid, only a "9000/InvalidLogin" error or a "9001/InvalidSession" error will be returned in the response. For more information about login errors, please see the WSDL documentation for the Login Web Service.

For the createPerson and updatePerson operations, not all of the parameters for the input Person object are required in all cases. If a parameter is not required, it may be omitted from the request. In such a case, it will take on the default value (null/empty value, unless otherwise specified) in our system in a createPerson call. In an updatePerson call, behaviour should be as mentioned below:
1. If a tag is not present, the corresponding value will not be updated in our system.
2. If a tag is present with no value, the corresponding value will be removed.
3. If a tag exists with new value, the corresponding value will be updated.

It is important to note that even when a parameter is required in a create call, if it is not required in an update call, it is marked as optional in the WSDL. Use the validation rules described below to ensure no wrong assumptions are made in these cases (if a field is not documented as being required, then it is optional).

One final note before we list the parameters and validation rules for this Web Service. Even though each person has his/her own password and email format (HTML or text) settings, these cannot be set via the Person Web Service.  Instead, in a createPerson call these are initialized to the default password and email format setup for the customer.  To change these please ask somebody in your company who has admin access to change them in the People Admin screen.

  <wsdl:documentation>The Chrome River Login Web Service fulfills requests from our customers to log in to our Web Services platform.

To get started with Chrome River Web Services, please submit a Chrome River Help Desk ticket. Our Implementation team will work with you to get everything set up and running.

To access this service, use this Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file to generate the required client proxy classes: https://api.chromeriver.com/ws_LoginV1?wsdl

Please also read this documentation to understand what it does and how to properly prepare requests.

Logging In

Each request to access a Chrome River Web Service must be authenticated via either login credentials or a session token. The Login Web Service may be used to submit the user's login information in a request consisting of companyID, userID, and password. The user will receive a token to submit with subsequent requests to other Chrome River Web Services, eliminating the need to provide the login information again. 

While it is also possible to submit login information directly via the header of every Chrome River Web Service, it is recommended that customers use the Login Web Service first to obtain a session token, and then submit this token in each subsequent request to the other services.

Chrome River Login Web Service Overview

Only one operation is exposed via the Login Web Service: createSession. The purpose of this operation is to submit login credentials and get in response a session token used to access other Chrome River Web Services. The token will renew each time it is used in a request. It will expire after 30 minutes of inactivity, at which point a new token must be acquired by resubmitting the login credentials to this service.

Each call to the createSession operation requires the LoginCredentials input object, which contains two parameters: token and user. This object is actually a shared input across all Chrome River Web Services. In services other than the Login Service, the token parameter is used to submit the session ID along with the rest of the request. In the Login Service, use the user parameter to set the required login credentials: companyID, userID, and password. 

The service responds to a request with the MessageEnvelope object. In the event of a successful outcome, the envelope will contain the statusCode "ReturnStatusCode.SUCCESS," along with a session token in the sessionID field. In the event of a failed outcome, the envelope will contain the statusCode "ReturnStatusCode.FAIL," along with a list of ValidationError objects detailing why the request was not successful. Each ValidationError contains three pieces of information: the error code, the name of the error code, and a brief message explaining the error.

In the Login Service there are two possible error scenarios: 

1. Invalid Login
=====================
Description: The credentials provided do not match a valid record in our system.
Error Code: 9000
Error Name: InvalidLogin
Error Message: Invalid login information
Resolution: Double-check that the companyID, userID, and password match those provided to you previously by Chrome River.

2. Invalid Session
=====================
Description: The token provided is not valid or has expired.
Error Code: 9001
Error Name: InvalidSession
Error Message: No session, or session no longer valid.
Resolution: Log in again with full credentials to obtain a new and valid session token.
